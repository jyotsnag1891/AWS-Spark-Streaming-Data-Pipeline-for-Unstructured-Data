# AWS-Spark-Streaming-Data-Pipeline-for-Unstructured-Data

Objective:
Develop a streaming data pipeline using Apache Spark to process both structured (JSON) and unstructured (text) data sources. The pipeline will extract relevant information from the unstructured text data, parse JSON data, perform transformations, and store the results in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.

Technologies Used:

Apache Spark (PySpark)
Docker for containerization
AWS S3 for data storage
AWS Athena for querying and analysis

Project Components:

Dockerized Apache Spark Setup:
Configure a Dockerized Apache Spark cluster setup using Docker Compose to facilitate distributed data processing.

Spark Session Setup:
Initialize a SparkSession within the Docker containers with the necessary configurations to run Spark jobs.

User-Defined Functions (UDFs):
Define a set of user-defined functions (UDFs) within the Spark environment to extract specific information from unstructured text data.

Streaming Data Ingestion:
Read streaming data from text files stored in a local directory.
Read streaming data from JSON files stored in another local directory.
Define a schema for the JSON data to ensure proper parsing.

Data Transformation:
Extract the first line of text from each file to use as the file name.
Cleanse the file names by removing any carriage return characters.
Combine the data from text and JSON sources into a unified DataFrame.

Streaming Data Processing:
Perform necessary data transformations using DataFrame operations.
Parse JSON data to extract structured information.
Process unstructured text data using custom UDFs to extract relevant details.
Combine and aggregate data as needed.
Prepare the data for storage or further analysis.

Data Storage:
Write the processed data to an S3 bucket for long-term storage.
Organize the data using Parquet file format for efficiency and performance.
Utilize checkpointing for fault tolerance and resiliency in case of failures.

Monitoring and Management:
Monitor the streaming job using Spark's built-in capabilities.
Manage checkpoints and job configurations for optimal performance.
Handle errors and exceptions gracefully to ensure uninterrupted data processing.

Querying and Analysis (Optional):
Use AWS Athena to query the stored data for analysis and insights.
Configure Athena to access the S3 bucket where the data is stored.
Perform ad-hoc queries and analyze the data using SQL syntax.

Conclusion:
The Spark streaming data pipeline efficiently processes both structured and unstructured data from multiple sources within Docker containers, leveraging Apache Spark, AWS S3, and Athena. This comprehensive solution showcases expertise in modern data engineering practices, facilitating real-time data processing, analysis, and insights for informed decision-making.
